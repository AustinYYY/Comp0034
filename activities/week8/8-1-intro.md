# Adding pages to a Flask app

This week's activity cover pages that interact with data. The activities try to cover a range to cover the different
features that students have in their apps. You are not expected to produce all of these in your own app.

- Pages that get data from a database
- Pages that get data from an API
- Pages that capture data with forms
- Pages that include a chart
- Pages that return a machine learning prediction

The activities include alternatives for SQLAlchemy and sqlite3 where relevant.
