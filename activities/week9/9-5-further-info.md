# Further information

I have read and watched content from the following and would recommend these. They do not always follow the same
approaches I have taken in the tutorials; any of the approaches are good though sometimes you may not be able to
integrate code from one person's app structure with code from another.

Testing specific chapters:

- Patrick Kennedy (uses pytest and unittest): https://testdriven.io/blog/flask-pytest/
- PrettyPrinted (uses pytest): https://youtu.be/RLKW7ZMJOf4?si=IRAt4BVs_DTug0Tb
- Miguel Grinberg (uses
  unittest): https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/how-to-write-unit-tests-in-python-part-3-web-applications
- NeuralNine (uses unittest): https://youtu.be/Y5CA79rHEYQ?si=VWrvzgR1ZH6I0D7g&t=761

- [NeuralNine YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7yh-TELLS1EyAye_UMnlsTGKxg8uatkM)
- [Patrick Kennedy YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=patrick+kennedy+flask)
  and [blog](https://testdriven.io/guides/flask-deep-dive/) - covers specific topics only such as understanding
  requests and testing

Look for tutorials in the last few years if possible and check the versions that the tutorials are using. Flask is
currently at [version 3.1](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/) and SQLAlchemy
at [version 2.0](https://pypi.org/project/SQLAlchemy/).
